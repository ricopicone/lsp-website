# LSP Website — Project Context

The Lacanian School of Psychoanalysis registration and payment website — a Django
application. This file orients a Claude Code session; the planning documents have
the full detail.

## What this is

Phase 1 of a custom website for the Lacanian School of Psychoanalysis (LSP),
replacing a Wix + Typeform setup. Phase 1 scope: user accounts and roles, event
registration, and payments. Target: registration live by ~mid-July 2026.

Planning documents live in the parent `LSP-Web-Coordinator` folder, alongside this repo:

- `../LSP-Website-Requirements-Spec.md` — what the site must do (requirement IDs:
  `USR-*` accounts, `REG-*` registration/payment, `PROG-*` events, etc.).
- `../LSP-Website-Architecture-Phase1.md` — the architecture and data model this
  build follows. Read it before making structural decisions.

## Tech stack

- Django 5.2 LTS, Python 3.10+ (`.python-version` pins 3.10; `requires-python` is
  `>=3.10`, so raising it is free).
- uv for dependencies and the virtual environment.
- SQLite for local development; PostgreSQL in production (via `DATABASE_URL`).
- Stripe (hosted Checkout) for payments and Amazon SES for email — not yet built.
- Hosting: AWS, on the `register.lacanschool.org` subdomain.

## Commands

```
uv sync                                  # install dependencies
uv run python manage.py migrate          # apply migrations (local SQLite)
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser  # create an admin (prompts for email)
uv run python manage.py runserver        # dev server at http://localhost:8000/
uv run pytest                            # run the test suite
uv run ruff check .                      # lint
```

## Layout and conventions

```
config/         project — settings/, urls.py, wsgi.py, asgi.py
  settings/     base.py + development.py (default) + production.py
accounts/       custom User, Profile, roles   <- built
events/         events, seminars, pricing     <- stub
registrations/  registrations                 <- stub
payments/       payments, receipts, Stripe     <- stub
core/           shared utilities              <- stub
```

- Settings are split by environment. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` defaults to
  `config.settings.development`; production uses `config.settings.production`.
- Configuration comes from environment variables (django-environ); see
  `.env.example`. No secrets in the repo.
- `accounts.User` is a **custom user model** (email login, no username) and is
  already wired as `AUTH_USER_MODEL`. Extend it; never swap it.
- Every `User` gets a `Profile` automatically via a post-save signal.
  `Profile.role` (seven LSP roles) is the single source of truth for pricing
  tiers and members-only access.
- Tests use pytest-django; lint with ruff. Keep both green — CI runs them on push.

## Design principle: do not over-automate

The school explicitly asked that automation not remove human discretion. Faculty
use sliding-scale and "none turned away for lack of funds" pricing; tuition-paying
members are exempt from seminar fees; some faculty bill per class. Every automated
path must keep a manual staff override. See architecture document sections 4.1
and 6.4.

## Status

Done (see `git log` for specifics):

- Project scaffold — Django project, five apps, split settings, GitHub Actions CI,
  smoke test.
- User / Profile / roles — email-login `User`, `Profile` with the seven LSP roles
  and a `tuition_paying` flag, auto-created per user, plus the admin back office.

Next, to finish Milestone 1:

- CSV bulk-import management command — load known users (name, email, role); `USR-3`.
- AWS skeleton deployment.
- Separately, an external task: begin Amazon SES domain/DKIM verification.

Milestones 2–8 then cover events and pricing, the registration flow, Stripe,
dues and donations, manual overrides and tests, deploy and pilot dry-run, and
opening registration.

## Task tracking

The eight Phase 1 milestones and broader project context live in the "LSP
Management" project of the web coordinator's project-management app, reached
through an MCP "projects connector" (tasks #213–#220). That connector is
configured in the Cowork environment used for planning; add it to this Claude
Code session's MCP config if you want to update those tasks from here.
